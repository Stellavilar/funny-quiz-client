# Front-end of Funny Quiz application

## Funny Quiz is a quiz game application with several questions from different levels.

- To build the client side, I have used React JS and semantic-ui to implement some elements (input, form, buttons, etc.).

- The data is called from an API that I've built on funny-quiz-server, and that I have deployed on AWS Cloudfront.

Stack:
- React Js
- React-Router
- React-slideshow-image
- Semantic-ui React
- Sass
- Axios
